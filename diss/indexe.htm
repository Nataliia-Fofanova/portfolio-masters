<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The variety of presentation options, and post information on the site, and
and lack of scientific study and systematization of relevant experience makes
the task of developing algorithms and methods of quality control software (sites)
extremely urgent. Implementation of the developed algorithms will ensure
not only high quality of the final software product (site), but also improving
the effectiveness of its use.</p>
<p>To perform the task need to highlight features of construction
sites, taking into account a number of factors. These include: constructive presentation of information
(usability of the site), high-quality eye-catching design, creative ideas and solutions,
advanced content management functionality (amendments,
additions and so forth.). Of particular importance is such a characteristic as basic features
site optimization for search engines, and others.</p>
<p>Questions of the organization of quality control developed software products (
particular sites) are presented in the works of Russian and foreign authors as
S. Dobrynin, Bosov AV and etc. <a href='#ref7'>[7]</a>, <a href='#ref8'>[8]</a>, <a href='#ref9'>[9]</a>.</p>
<p>The analysis revealed a difference in approach to the assessment of different sites
authors. The proposed work is qualitatively different from the technique of the analytes,
it is based on existing standards (ISO / IEC 9126-93 "Assessment
software products ") and the maximum number of estimated parameters.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to GOST R ISO / IEC 9126-93 "Evaluation of software products" <a href='#ref10'>[10]</a>,
the site shall be of such quality characteristics as functional
possibilities, reliability, usability, efficiency, maintainability and portability,
and features inherent sites in accordance with data characteristics.
</p>
<p>Functionalities include a number of characteristics, such as:
the suitability, accuracy, interoperability, consistency,
protection. Suitability characterizes the site in terms of its possession of the minimum
featured (content). Correctness means that the site should accurately reflect
and the data entered. Interoperability shows how the system
It interacts with the operating system (in this security products
cross-platform). Consistency describes the site in terms of compliance
laws and rules of its design (for example: the law on the content of the site). Protection
It shows how the site should be protected from the content
unauthorized access.</p>
<p>Next a number of characteristics presented reliability and includes
performance stability, fault tolerance and recoverability. Stability
It means that the site has the smallest number of failures in the software error. Resistance to
an error saying that the site has to maintain a certain level of quality in
cases, software bugs. For example, the user has no support for flash
PC and need to transfer all the information in flash in a different format for the
User. Recoverability shows that when an error is able to quickly site
restore its functionality (the site has no specific interaction with
client and therefore has immediate error recovery at
user).</p>
<p>Indicators practicality characterize understandability, learnability, simplicity
use. Clarity means that the site should be clear and well
perceived by the user. Learning suggests that the site contains a number of
Tips for proper use of the website by the user. Ease of use
It characterizes the site in terms of ease of navigation, simplicity and speed in finding
necessary information.</p>
<p>One of the most important sets of characteristics including performance indicators. This
characteristics such as: changes in the nature of resources and the nature of the change in time.
They say that the site should be well optimized for fast operation.</p>
<p>Next inherent characteristic of software products - maintainability -
presented figures testability, stability, variability analyzed.
Testability means that the site should be easily verifiable with the modifications
(For example, uses a technology called "Apache" to check the site on the local machine).
Stability indicates that the site is protected from the risk of unsuccessful modifications i.e.
roll back changes (any modification on the site can be removed manually from the code of the page).
The variability characterizes the site in terms of the possibility of modification (for
minimal modification site can use any text editor, except for a few
cgi-scripts). It indicates the presence of the analyte at the site diagnostic devices
self-empowerment and modifications necessary software to achieve the best
performance (for example: if the site requires java or flash later,
the user may be prompted to modify the software).</p>
<p>Last number of characteristics presented indicators of mobility and includes:
adaptability, ease of implementation, compliance, interchangeability. Adaptability
It means that the site should work on any software. Ease of implementation indicates that
the site should function under any set of user software. Compliance -
characteristics, to express to the site laws of the country in which it is
used. Interchangeability indicates that the site is capable of substitution
such resource without much difficulty.</p>
<p>One of the key points to consider when building a website - it
that the Internet is generally a source of information. Thus, the site as part of
Internet should provide as much information to visitors and users.
In addition, visitors have easy to navigate in its pages. more
site gives answers to the issues facing the visitors, the higher the probability that
they will use it in the future.</p>
<p>Estimation of parameters such as traffic and demand for content is suitable
and is effective only after a certain period of time the work site,
so these figures will not be counted.<a href='#ref11'>[11]</a></p>

<h2>1. Theme urgency</h2>
<p>
Today, information technologies have begun to actively influence the daily activities of any organization and become an integral component of its
information infrastructure. Modern website <a href="ref15">[15]</a>, <a href="ref16">16</a>, <a href="ref17">[17]</a> - This extensive system
software, information, media resources, logically interrelated.
Therefore, among the site developers highlight the category of professional researchers the quality of these products.
The dynamic development of the sphere of web development gives rise
the need for the scientific study of quality of the site in order to create objective advice. </p>

<p>The results of this assessment should reflect the characteristics of the quality of web sites and used as developers for certification of the product, and customers
the acquisition of sites. The quality of sites is an integral characteristic, including a wide range of product properties and
determines the degree of user satisfaction.</p>

<p>A number of methods for evaluating the quality of sites, which are described AG Gavrilov, ES Kubashevoy article "Methodology of quality sites." article solves the problem of the development of algorithms and methods of control
quality products (websites)<a href="ref11">[11]</a>. 
Article O. Pilate "Information technology evaluation of the quality of sites," a mathematical model of the integrated assessment of the quality of the website.
She provided obtaining results through questionnaires and evaluation of quality indicators and the ranking of categories of quality. analyzed the most important
Factors affecting the quality of a website and ranking quality categories. The model accounts for the weights of each individual category. <a href="ref12">[12]</a>
The article T. Maksiyanovoy "Methodology of business efficiency in e-commerce" proposed assessment methodology
the efficiency of Internet companies in the field of e-commerce based on the stages of decision-making Internet users to buy,
principles of organization of Internet commerce and the factors affecting the performance of Internet companies.<a href="ref14"></a>
In the article "Development of quality assessment sites Libraries" OV Kulyov the problem of providing high quality sites of cultural institutions.
A system for assessing the quality of websites of libraries, including the evaluation criteria and procedures. The basis for the definition of key aspects of the formation of the system
Site evaluation criteria were the software and hardware systems, and resource library. The methods of data collection, as well as the process and
forms of measurement suitable to measure the quality of sites.<a href="ref14"></a>
And Article V. Garkin, RN Chen "Development and research of methods of load and functional assessment of the quality informatsionn³h systems" addressed the issues of development and research methodology load and functional evaluation of the web service of the Faculty of Economic Informatics KNUE.<a name="ref18">
</p>
<p>These methods and models have some efficacy, but for most economical realization, they must be combined.</p>
<p>Master's thesis is devoted to actual scientific problem of development of quality assessment of web sites. The target base developed techniques studied.</p>

<h3>3.1 Development of morphological model</h3>
<br>
<p>
Morphological model is a combination of the following models:
<ul><li>model is a "black box";</li>
<li>model composition of the system;</li>
<li>model of the structure of the system.</li></ul></p>
<p>The model "black box" includes:
<ul>
<li>model border;</li>
<li>a model of the environment of the system;</li>
<li>Model inputs System;</li>
<li>Model output systems.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>This model is a reference model in the construction of complex systems and focuses on the interaction with the external environment. This interaction is carried out by exposure to the system on the environment through the results of its targeted operation, ie through the desired product. Target system products - it exits the system.
In turn, the external environment has an impact on the system through the provision of resource management and various controllable and uncontrollable factors that facilitate or impede the normal functioning of the system. Such links with the system of the environment (environmental impact on the system) called the input system.
The scheme itself is depicted as a "non-transparent box", with the contents of the box were not disclosed. Therefore, the model is called the "black box."</p>
<p>To develop a model of the "black box" is necessary to determine
the boundaries of the "process of assessing the quality of the development sites", the external environment, the ins and outs of the system.</p>
<p>The border of the "process of assessing the quality of the development sites" determined "website address";
</p>
<p>As the external environment of the "quality evaluation process
development sites" are:	<br>Internet competitors, CMS, device users.</p>
<p>Logon "process of assessing the quality of the development sites" are:
<ul>
<li>õ1  application for evaluating the quality of the product;</li>
<li>õ2  technical specification client;</li>
<li>õ3  Investment Projects Clients;</li>
<li>õ4  customer site.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>To exit the system, "the process of assessing the quality of the development sites"
include:
<ul><li>ó1 - planning analysis;</li>
<li>ó2 - selection methodology;</li>
<li>ó3 - recommendations for improving the quality in the future and report on the work performed.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Model structure.</p>
<p>System, its internal structure is usually heterogeneous, which makes it necessary to distinguish its internal parts.
</p>
<p>The system components and subsystems distinguish different levels.
</p>
<p>Element - part of a system or subsystem, further fragmentation which does not make sense. Subsystem - it's part of the system with some links and relations.
</p>
<p>The companies are the following constituent elements:<ul><dl>
<dt>1.Research Department:</dt>
<dd>1.1.Project manager;</dd>
<dd>1.2.Analyst;</dd>
<dd>1.3.Economist.</dd>
<dt>2.implementation Unit:</dt>
<dd>2.1.Web designer;</dd>
<dd>2.2.Make up man;</dd>
<dd>2.3.Programmer;</dd>
<dd>2.4.Software testing.</dd>

</p>
</div>
<p>Model structure. </p>
<p>Any system is determined not only by the composition of its parts, but also the order and manner of combining these parts into a whole. All parts (components) of the system are in a certain relationship or connections with each other. The structure - a set of links between elements of the system.
</p>

<p>For the model of the structure to determine the relationship between elements and subsystems.
The following are descriptions of these links:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Ó11-12  hierarchical relationship. Project Manager provides the data for the analysis of the project analysis..</li>
<li>Ó12-11  Analyst conducts a cursory analysis of the resource is a report and sends it to the project manager.</li>
<li>Ó12-13  Analyst reports project report by economists to calculate the cost of the project.</li>
<li>Ó11-13 - Project Manager provides the data for the calculation of the project economist.</li>
<li>Ó13-11 - Economist of the financial statements and reports to the manager of projects.</li>
<li>Ó21-22  The designer creates a template and transmits it to a typesetter.</li>
<li>Ó22-23  Imposer creates a framework site and transmits it back for revision programmer.</li>
<li>Ó23-24  Software programs the website and sends it to the tester for detailed testing.</li>
<li>Ó24-21  Tester creates test cases with errors web designer to finalize.</li>
<li>Ó24-22 - Tester creates test cases with errors typesetter for completion.</li>
<li>Ó24-23 - Tester creates test cases with errors programmer for completion.</li>
<li>Ó24-11  Tester sends the report project manager.</li>
<li>Ó24-12  Tester sends a report analyst for further analysis.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The structure of the investigated system can be represented as a hierarchy (The Picture 1.4), since obviously a clear subordination of some other parts of the system.</p>
<p>The Picture 1.4 it is clear that the project manager manages the analyst and economist. The analyst is responsible for the sales department, namely to work Web designer, coder, programmer and tester.</p>

<h3>3.2 The synthesis of functional model</h3>
<p>Functional modeling - is the process of modeling the functions performed by the system or object under consideration by creating a narrative, structured, graphic, indicating that, as someone made in the framework of object linking these functions based on the information available.</p>
<p>The functional model designed to study the characteristics of the system and its purpose in relation to the internal and external elements.</p>
<p>As technology IDEF functional model - a set of closely interacting descriptions starting with a description of the top level of the entire system and ending with detailed description of parts, called charts. The system model building: the creation of a top-level diagram, called a context diagram (A-0); Decomposition of the diagram (A <sub> 0 </sub>); decomposition of each block diagram A <sub> 0 </sub>.</p>
</p>
<p>Construction context diagram.</p>
<p>To build chart you must define the content main function of the system inputs and outputs in it, manage, and the mechanism by which the function of the system is performed.
</p>
<p> For the process of assessing the quality of the development site's main function is to assess the quality of the site.</p>
<p>The inputs are:
<ul>
<li>õ1  application;</li>
<li>õ2  technical specification(TS);</li>
<li>õ3  Investment;</li>
<li>õ4 - website.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The outputs are:
<ul>
<li>ó1 - product analyzed;</li>
<li>ó2 - increase in profit for the company customer.</li>
<li>ó3 - Progress report and recommendations for improvement in the future.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Management is carried out by special instruments and standards (GOST, ISO, etc.).</p>
<p>The control mechanism - the company which is engaged in this activity.</p>

<h3>3.3 Development of information model</h3>
<p>The basic concepts of information models are: the external object, the task, the data warehouse, information flow, material flow, storage of material objects.
</p>
<p>Information model displays: problems solved components of the system and the place of their decisions, the objects of the external environment (how and where the data comes from a block of tasks and storage), data warehouse, information flows, material and documentary flows.
</p>
<p>The model does not show: no clear organizational structure of the system, the full understanding of the hierarchy of elements, the functional area (functional structure of the system).</p>
<p>Here are the information model of the "quality of the evaluation process" and decomposed model of information system model "evaluation process quality.</p>
<p>Consider the information model of the process developed by the Quality Assessment Web resource, shown in the picture 3.1.</p>
<div class=img>
<img src="images/ph12.png" width=600 height=700 alt="Information model of quality evaluation">
<p class=imgcaption>The Picture 3.1.  Information model of quality evaluation</p>
</div>
<p>The diagram shows a model that describes the interaction of internal company that deals with the analysis of sites, with the customer. The customer submits an application and the company, consulting, takes a decision (to accept or reject the customer's request). Reject applications if everything is fine with the site or else incompetent experts in solving the problems of the client.</p>
<p>In case the application is accepted, the company takes on the customer site and developed technical specification (TS) for analysis of the site and the task. Later negotiated cost of the project.</p>
<p>After the initial analysis of the company with the customer specifies the problems of the site and making recommendations for improvement, if the customer agrees to the terms, the company is starting to fulfill the tasks. The database recorded customer data and all documents provided to them. The storage company puts customer data and projects. At the end of the project the payment is made.</p>
<p>Block 1 - made the reception and analysis of the applications, as well as discussion of the project with the customer. Block 2 - Create a site layout designer. Block 3 - designed layout of the site. Block 4 - programmed the remaining part of the site. Block 5 is made testing site tester.</p>
<p>	The Picture 3.2. is presented to decompose the model block 1 on the picture 3.1.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>For the systematic study developed morphological, functional and information model.
The structure of the object of study is described morfologichnoy model.
A functional model was presented in the form of diagrams and IDEF decomposed to level 3.
The information model is based on the methodology of DFD and complements the functional model.
</p> 
<p> The results can be used as the basic structure for deeper detail and the decomposition of its units,
 complementing and expanding in accordance with the change of criteria or other factors affecting the research object.
</p>
<p> Further research focuses on the following aspects: 
<ol>
<li> A qualitative improvement of the approach to the development of the resource, its complement and expand.
